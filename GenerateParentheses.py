# Challenge: Generate Parentheses
# For a given number n, generate all valid balanced parentheses strings containing n sets of parentheses


# My solution is based on the fact that each distinct balanced parentheses string of the same length
# will have it;s left parentheses in a different layout. So, I cycle through the first left parentheses,
# the second, the third and so on, creating string each string based on where the next left parentheses can go, and
# keeping track of how many right parentheses can be added at most before the next left parentheses.
